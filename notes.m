%goal is not to quantify the oxides but to locate them
%other methods are better at quantifying

%look into switching lsqnonlin into a linear optimization
%tried using as system of equation solver and does not work because system
%is not consistent

%focus on uncertainty
%function outputs residual, residual squared ,and jacobian

%processed and unproccessed maps
%take weighted averages to find the 18 points on the unprocessed
%subtract processed from unprocessed
%add a folder to map folders that holds the spectrum of that sample to
%automate above process for all maps

%subtract out the metal reference from the signal and then fit?
