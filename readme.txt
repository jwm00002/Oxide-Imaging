The folders within the project contain map data
There are some .txt and .xls files that contain reference data in the project folder

energy_residual_plottig
	plots the residual of the fit at each energy level
mapDataDisplay
	plots the mapData for each energy level on a seperate graph
micky_optimization
	was a precursor to shift_optimization that does multiple runs of xrayPercentAnalysis to find the best shift values
notes
	contains project notes
readQX
	is a program that was put together quickly to read QX spectra files
shift_optimization
	takes around 8 hours to run and does numerous runs of xrayPercentAnalysis writes the results to an excel file to find the best shift values
spectrumPlotting
	is the file used to run xrayMapAnalysis(the main goal of the project)
XraySpecFunctions
	contains almost the entirety of the project code, it contains many different functions useful to the project such as reading data files and handling the maps and reference arrays
